        <h1>CRICKET</h1>
        </center>
        <P>Cricket is a bat-and-ball game played between two teams of eleven players on a field at the centre of which
            is a 22-yard (20-metre) pitch with a wicket at each end, each comprising two bails balanced on three stumps.
            Two players from the batting team (the striker and nonstriker) stand in front of either wicket, with one
            player from the fielding team (the bowler) bowling the ball towards the striker's wicket from the opposite
            end of the pitch. The striker's goal is to hit the bowled ball and then switch places with the nonstriker,
            with the batting team scoring one run for each exchange. Runs are also scored when the ball reaches or
            crosses the boundary of the field or when the ball is bowled illegally.

            The fielding team tries to prevent runs from being scored by dismissing batters (so they are "out"). Means
            of dismissal include being bowled, when the ball hits the striker's wicket and dislodges the bails, and by
            the fielding side either catching the ball after it is hit by the bat, but before it hits the ground, or
            hitting a wicket with the ball before a batter can cross the crease in front of the wicket. When ten batters
            have been dismissed, the innings ends and the teams swap roles. The game is adjudicated by two umpires,
            aided by a third umpire and match referee in international matches. They communicate with two off-field
            scorers who record the match's statistical information.</P>
